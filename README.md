# Droplet
Droplet is a **business inventory management system for eBay** I made for my eBay business to help keep track of items in my inventory, their orders, and estimated profit for each item. Although I have written this primarily for my usage, I have hopefully made it as usable for others as I could.

## Installation
Right now there's no official binary package, and might not be until the official v1.0 release. However you can build and run it yourself, see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

We will not merge pull requests unless all checks pass and at least one of the repository maintainers approves it.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.
